# Contributing

We welcome any contribution to our project, however we have to note that this project was build during our time as students at the University of Groningen. We therefore don't plan on adding any new features or responding to pull requests. Every work we will perform in the future will be completeley voluntarily.

If you encounter any bugs (or you want to create new features) feel free to make a pull request or contact me at konstantin.rolf@gmail.com. There are no special guidelines except that the changes should be well documented.
